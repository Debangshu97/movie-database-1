# hdmovies database webapp

Check out the cool webapp below -

[Visit Website](https://movie-database1.netlify.app/)



## Overview

This is a movies database application with top notch frontend tech like Redux & SCSS. Using the TMDB movies Api I created a database webapp where a user can go and search the trenidng, toprated and every other movie and tv show available on the internet and choose his next Sunday night watch!
## Tech Stack

The following technologies:

- React 18
- Redux Toolkit
- Vite
- Sass
- TMDB Api
- Axios
- Netlify

## Objectives

The idea is described in the following points:

- This is a webapp with multiple pages. The Home page opens up on visiting the website and the user can search for a specific movie or lookup up the popular or to prated ones.
- Easy maintainable and scalable folder structure
- Created carousel/slider without library just like in popular steraming platforms
- Created Infinite scrolling cause movies collection should be endless!
- Loading Skeleton while fetching data from API
- Error handling & 404 forbidden page
- Redux Toolkit used to hold state data throughout the app
- Responsive layout with perfectly placed media queries
- I access the movie database info from the TMDB api.
- Implement best practices and standards when structuring the files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
- Implemented CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets, inline styles and embedded style tags.I used Sass instead of vanilla CSS to better format the css file.
- Used Vite instead of Create-React-App as Vite is provides better features likes faster hot reload and less project setup time.
- I used netlify to deploy and host the app as it is very convenient and free.
